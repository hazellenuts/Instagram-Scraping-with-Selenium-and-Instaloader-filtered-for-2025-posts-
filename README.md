# Instagram-Scraping-with-Selenium-and-Instaloader-filtered-for-2025-posts-

Hi there, Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This script is designed to collect posts from the year 2025 for any Instagram account using **Selenium** and **Instaloader**. 

When I tried to get captions using Selenium, I couldnâ€™t reliably extract them, so I used Instaloader instead to fetch:
- Post captions
- Number of likes
- Number of comments

Before running the script, please make sure to do the following:

1. **Update the script**: Look for comments marked with `#` and replace them with your own Instagram username, password, target account URL, or any other settings as needed.

2. **Install ChromeDriver**: You need ChromeDriver for Selenium to work. Download it here: [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

3. **Install required libraries**: Make sure you have the necessary Python packages installed.


And thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰  
Now you can start scraping posts from 2025 for your chosen Instagram account.



**Happy scraping! ðŸš€**
